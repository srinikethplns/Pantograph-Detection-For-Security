# Pantograph-Detection-For-Security

This project was developed in association with a startup which was working with the indian railways. The dataset used is confidential and i can show only this much due to constraints. I used YOLOv8 to obtain this output. YOLOv8 is a CNN model which is used here to learn about the dataset and i here have only applied it on a pre processed video. I was asked to make it on a live video which i had done accordingly and that cannotbe shown here.
